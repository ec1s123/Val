This project was mainly inspired by the popular Tactical First Person Shooter Aim training games such as AimLabs and Kovaak's Aim Trainer. 
Due to my experience in Valorant I knew that warming up is essential to playing well, and the long load times with AimLabs and Kovaaks I saw a gap in the market for a browser based game that users can quick and easily load up and get ready for their games.
